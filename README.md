# Write Together #
 
## The Game ##
  > Write a story together with the help of the internet. For every sentence you write, the internet will automagically write the next. While we can't guarantee Shakespearean stardom, we can promise a fun experience!

## Users ##
  > This game was created for users who have basic written/spoken English proficiency and will likely be used by people who enjoy social sharing/media.

## Summary ##
  > Users will navigate to the webpage to find a simple interface inviting them to write a story. After completing their first sentence, it will be displayed on the screen. A magic, behind-the-scenes robot (YouTube) will write the next sentence in the story. The user can repeat the process until they feel that their story has reached complete awesomeness. 

## Problem ##
  > This is an iteration on a game played by many children in school by passing a paper around a table to write a story collaboratively. This app updates this game for the internet.

## Solution ##
  > Using a simple interface, this app will be as simple as writing on a piece of paper and passing it to your neighbor.

## Quote from You ##
  > "As a teacher, I loved playing this game with students; they always let their creativity shine through. As an adult, it was difficult to find time in life (or a group of people) who will sit down and write a story with you. Write Something! fixes that." -Adam (lead dev)

## How to Get Started ##
  > Navigate to the webpage, enter your first sentence into the text box, hit enter, and start writing!
